# Feature Driven and Point Process Approaches for Popularity Prediction
Code and Data for CIKM Paper Feature Driven and Point Process Approaches for Popularity Prediction

# We also provide a tutorial for using hawkes process to model real cascades

Steps covered are as follows:
* Plotting Memory function for the Social Kernel
* Simmulating events from a Marked Hawkes Process
* Modeling a retweet cascade with marked Hawkes Process
* Using the model to make predictions of final size

All this is illustrated with the notebook [file](https://github.com/s-mishra/featuredriven-hawkes/blob/master/code/marked_hawkes_point_process.ipynb) provided along with the rscripts.
